Reshade installation for Steam Deck on Arch Linux with Pacman

This is a small shell script that easlity installs Reshade (vkBasalt), an overlay (goverlay), and all the necessary dependencies for Steam Deck users running Arch Linux with Pacman. The script also installs Chaotic-AUR for easy installation of other programs.

To use the script:

1. Download the reshade-steamdeck.sh file to your desired directory.
2. Make the file executable by running chmod +x reshade-steamdeck.sh.
3. Run ./reshade-steamdeck.sh in the same directory as the file in the terminal.
4. After running the script, Reshade will be enabled on Steam Deck with an overlay (goverlay... set the hotkeys as needed.), and you can download all the shaders from the inside goverlay with no configuration needed (click sync). You can also use vkBasalt for additional effects.

*Note, not all shaders work, but most do. Here's a great resource to make sure your game is playable.

For more information on how to configure the overlay and effects, you can refer to various tutorials on YouTube.

Hope you enjoy!

I just made it v1.0 release, so nobody is downloading 1.1.

The reason I opted to just change the file instead of do a release is because people don't know how to do the releases and I already posted the link to Reddit.

Here's the reddit:

There's also a video I uploaded to mega on this reddit post that shows exactly how to do this.
